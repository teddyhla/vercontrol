# The Problem

---

-   Guidelines, policies etc. typically word documents (proprietary)
    emailed around.
-   Any collaborative research.

::: notes
Introduce the idea of working in silos and the difficulties of
collaboration. Obvious examples:
Aim to do as much of this as possible with visual slides only. I.e. keep
text to a minimum. Just speak to interesting visuals.
:::

---

Build some familiar examples of why these are problematic

-   The simple burden of collaborative writing by email
-   Track changes doesn't work if you are tracking a different document.
-   Someone tracks changes on a document 3 versions behind. Need to
    manually integrate.
-   There are solutions: trust could invest in expensive software
-   Tied into a monopoly (microsoft)
-   Alternatives? Google? Do we think the NHS would be comfortable with
    this?

How do others solve this issue?
Often in much harder circumstances?
Game development:
dozen or hundreds of developers often writing in different countries

## The Unreasonable Effectivenes of Plain Text and Version Control

---

## Examples

- Teddy and I are writing guidelines
- We want a microbiology peer review
- Our plane text documents are placed into version control
- Microbiologist provides peer review
- Pull request

::: notes
I'm tempted to avoid any special words like "pull request". Rather jsut
say "they make a request that our changes are incorporated".
:::

---

Now imagine that every NHS organisation does the same I now need to
write a guideline of hyponatraemia I know that St. Elshwere has a very
well established endocrine department We can find their guidelines on
their github account. Because its under version control, it contains a
full tree of every edit made by every professor.

---

Now we "fork" and adapt to our local needs These guidelines were quite
ward level heavy, and so we've adapted them

![](src/sub-branch.png)

::: notes
We actually already do this, but informally by stealing from other
trusts. This formalises and maintains the connection
:::

---

Now some bleeding edge research causes St. Elshwere to update their
guidelines We can see that we are now behind on their tree We can decide
if we want to incorporate the new changes ourselves or not

---

## Benefits

-   Practical: time saved, better collaboration, transparanecy

## Challenges

-   Some limited technical knowhow necessary
-   Buy in: change in the way we work
-   Comfort level putting work into public domain for those to find
