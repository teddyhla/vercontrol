## This is a talk about version control

::: notes
General outline:
1. Introduce the problem. Make it familiar and relatable.
  - Documentation focused collaboration in the NHS is fragmented and broken
2. Demonstrate a solution by using: Plain text (Markdown), git and github.
3. Tackle obvious criticisms:
  - We already have version control/track changes in word. Yes, but you haven't solved the emailing files issue
  - So use google docs. This isn't a realistic solution and many trusts will not accept working closely with google as a company.
4. Show the benefits beyond simple "track changes".
  - Multi-institute collaborations
  - Enhanced productivity
  - Re-visiting old branches/toughts
  - Total audit trail of peer review
5. Practical steps (How to get started? Where to go?)
  - Learn the tools: Markdown (already know some of this from whatsapp etc.), Git (this is a little code orientated, but there is software to help), Github.
  - Read the Turing Way
  - Speak to your IT department. Run a pilot
6. Contribute back
  - If you get this working write a chapter for healthcare collaboration in the turing way.

## The Problem

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Document collaboration in the NHS is broken.
- Lowest common demonimator; MS Word and email.
- guideline-version3-finalcomments49corrected.docx.lol is a symptom.

## Frustrating Examples

:::{.fragment}
- Colleague returns tracked changes on version 3. We're now on version 5.
- Trust only pays for word licences on certain PCs.
- Collaborator changes all the formatting and resized the figures.
:::
:::{.fragment}
- Solutions: cloud (MS word ðŸ’° / google ðŸ˜ˆ).
- Neither scales well.
- There are industries that have solved scalable document collaboration.

Game development:
dozen or hundreds of developers often writing in different countries
Ultimately these are just plane text files

Major international research collaborations:
CERN: Thousands of authors from multiple continents.

## {background-image="./src/linux.jpg"}

::: notes
Linux: Powers the internet and the vast majority of the phones in this room
Created the very tools we will discuss today to solve this issue

::: notes
They can do this because they use plain text^[@zotero-10683]
Plain text can be read by any computer, running any software
Plain text will continue to work while we have computers
No tie into a single company. No monopolies.

:::

::: notes
Introduce the turing way.
A decentralised group to bring these methods and technologies into the hands of scientists.
:::

## A (somewhat meta) Example

- Teddy and I are writing this presentation
- We don't use powerpoint; plain text!

---

## The Power of Plain Text

![](./src/markdown.png)

::: notes
Writing text without any formatting = efficiency.
:::

---

## Collaboration

- Each collaborator / idea lives in seperate **branches**.
- **Merged** when ready.
- Version controlled: implicit to the method of collaboration.

## Untapped Potential

- Imagine every NHS trust uses this approach
- we need a new hyponatraemia guidelines
- St. Elshwere; global reputation
- Find their guidelines on github: **Fork**

![](src/sub-branch.png)

::: notes
We do this already informally
:::

---

## Untapped Potential

- Major new RCT changes practice.
- St. Elsewhere updates their guidelines.
- **We are notified**.
- The change is ratified and instantly disseminated.

---

## Advantages/Benefits

- Practical: time saved, better collaboration, transparanecy
- Future proof
- Scalable

## Challenges

- **Some** technical knowhow necessary.
- Buy in: change in the way we work.
- Some friction now, for a massive payoff later.
- Network effects are multiplicative.
- Level of trust comfort: documents in public domain.

---

## Questions

- Why would we want to have guidelines in plain text?
- Formatting/branding? Develop trust templates.
- Webpage as output: high fidelity medium, video, audio, reactive.
