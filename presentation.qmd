# The Problem

::: notes
General outline:
1. Introduce the problem. Make it familiar and relatable.
  - Documentation focused collaboration in the NHS is fragmented and broken
2. Demonstrate a solution by using: Plain text (Markdown), git and github.
3. Tackle obvious criticisms:
  - We already have version control/track changes in word. Yes, but you haven't solved the emailing files issue
  - So use google docs. This isn't a realistic solution and many trusts will not accept working closely with google as a company.
4. Show the benefits beyond simple "track changes".
  - Multi-institute collaborations
  - Enhanced productivity
  - Re-visiting old branches/toughts
  - Total audit trail of peer review
5. Practical steps (How to get started? Where to go?)
  - Learn the tools: Markdown (already know some of this from whatsapp etc.), Git (this is a little code orientated, but there is software to help), Github.
  - Read the Turing Way
  - Speak to your IT department. Run a pilot
6. Contribute back
  - If you get this working write a chapter for healthcare collaboration in the turing way.

## Some Context

::: {.column width="40%"}
- Document collaboration in the NHS is broken.
- Inevitably reverting to the lowest common demonimator.
- MS Word and emails.
- guideline-version3-finalcomments49corrected.docx.lol is a symptom.

## Frustrating Examples

:::{.fragment}
- Colleague returns tracked changes on version 3. We're now on version 5.
- Trust only pays for word licences on certain PCs.
- Collaborator changes all the formatting and resized the figures.
:::
:::{.fragment}
- Solutions: cloud (MS word ðŸ’° / google ðŸ˜ˆ).
- There are industries that have solved scalable document collaboration.

::: notes
Game development:
dozen or hundreds of developers often writing in different countries
Ultimately these are just plane text files

Major international research collaborations:
CERN: Thousands of authors from multiple continents.

Linux: Powers the internet and the vast majority of the phones in this room
Created the very tools we will discuss today to solve this issue

# Plain Text

## A (somewhat meta) Example

- Teddy and I are writing this presentation
- We don't use powerpoint

![](./src/github.png)

---

![](./src/tracked-change.png)

---

![](./src/pull-request.png)

---

::: notes
I'm tempted to avoid any special words like "pull request". Rather jsut
say "they make a request that our changes are incorporated".
:::

---

Now imagine that every NHS organisation does the same I now need to
write a guideline of hyponatraemia I know that St. Elshwere has a very
well established endocrine department We can find their guidelines on
their github account. Because its under version control, it contains a
full tree of every edit made by every professor.

---

![](./src/project-history.svg)

---

Now we "fork" and adapt to our local needs These guidelines were quite
ward level heavy, and so we've adapted them

![](src/sub-branch.png)

::: notes
We actually already do this, but informally by stealing from other
trusts. This formalises and maintains the connection
:::

---

Now some bleeding edge research causes St. Elshwere to update their
guidelines We can see that we are now behind on their tree We can decide
if we want to incorporate the new changes ourselves or not

---

## Advantages/Benefits

- Practical: time saved, better collaboration, transparanecy
- Future proof
- Scalable

## Challenges

-   Some limited technical knowhow necessary
-   Buy in: change in the way we work
-   Comfort level putting work into public domain for those to find

---

- Why would we want to have guidelines in plane text?
- What about formatting?
- Why don't you want to target a webpage?
- If you have to, develop template that convert into your trust formats

## Next Steps

- Network
- Have a look at the Turing Way

## Credits

- Refernce Turing Way
- Reference Art Work
- No boilerplate
