# The Problem

::: notes
General outline:
1. Introduce the problem. Make it familiar and relatable.
2. Demonstrate a solution by using: Markdown, git and github (or similar)
3. Tackle obvious criticisms:
  - We already have version control/track changes in word. Yes, but you haven't solved the emailing files issue
  - So use google docs. This isn't a realistic solution and many trusts will not accept working closely with google as a company.
4. Show the benefits beyond simple "track changes".
  - Multi-institute collaborations
  - Enhanced productivity
  - Re-visiting old branches/toughts
  - Total audit trail of peer review
5. Practical steps (How to get started? Where to go?)
  - Learn the tools: Markdown (already know some of this from whatsapp etc.), Git (this is a little code orientated, but there is software to help), Github.
  - Read the Turing Way
  - Speak to your IT department. Run a pilot
6. Contribute back
  - If you get this working write a chapter for healthcare collaboration in the turing way.

## Some Context

::: {.column width="40%"}

- Document collaboration in the NHS is broken
- Reverts to the lowest common demonimator
- MS Word and emails

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}
![](./src/clippy.png)
:::

::: notes
- A bit of background
- Microsoft dominance in the 90s/2000s led to MS Word being the default collaborative writing tool
- Based around collaboration in the open plan office
- Less suited to healthcare: No desks. Itinerant workers. etc.
- Most collaboration falls back to the lowest common demominator of MS word.

## Frustration

:::{.fragment}
- Colleague returns tracked changes on version 3. We're now on version 5.
:::
:::{.fragment}
- There are solutions: cloud (MS word ðŸ’° / google ðŸ˜ˆ)
- Can we look to other industries for inspiration?
:::

::: notes
Build some familiar examples of why these are problematic

-   The simple burden of collaborative writing by email
-   Track changes doesn't work if you are tracking a different document.
-   Someone tracks changes on a document 3 versions behind. Need to
    manually integrate.
-   There are solutions: trust could invest in expensive software
-   Tied into a monopoly (microsoft)
-   Alternatives? Google? Do we think the NHS would be comfortable with
    this?

Game development:
dozen or hundreds of developers often writing in different countries
Ultimately these are just plane text files

# The Unreasonable Effectivenes of Plain Text and Version Control

---

## A (somewhat meta) Example

- Teddy and I are writing this presentation
- We don't use powerpoint

![](./src/main-branch.png)
 
---

![](./src/one-branch.png)

---

![](./src/github.png)

---

![](./src/tracked-change.png)

---

![](./src/pull-request.png)

---

::: notes
I'm tempted to avoid any special words like "pull request". Rather jsut
say "they make a request that our changes are incorporated".
:::

---

Now imagine that every NHS organisation does the same I now need to
write a guideline of hyponatraemia I know that St. Elshwere has a very
well established endocrine department We can find their guidelines on
their github account. Because its under version control, it contains a
full tree of every edit made by every professor.

---

![](./src/project-history.svg)

---

Now we "fork" and adapt to our local needs These guidelines were quite
ward level heavy, and so we've adapted them

![](src/sub-branch.png)

::: notes
We actually already do this, but informally by stealing from other
trusts. This formalises and maintains the connection
:::

---

Now some bleeding edge research causes St. Elshwere to update their
guidelines We can see that we are now behind on their tree We can decide
if we want to incorporate the new changes ourselves or not

---

## Benefits

-   Practical: time saved, better collaboration, transparanecy

## Challenges

-   Some limited technical knowhow necessary
-   Buy in: change in the way we work
-   Comfort level putting work into public domain for those to find

---

- Why would we want to have guidelines in plane text?
- What about formatting?
- Why don't you want to target a webpage?
- If you have to, develop template that convert into your trust formats

## Practicalities

## Next Steps

- Network
- Have a look at the Turing Way

## Credits

- Refernce Turing Way
- Reference Art Work
- No boilerplate
